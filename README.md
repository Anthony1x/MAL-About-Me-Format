# MAL-About-Me-Format

MyAnimeList does not support Visual Novels.

I would still like to keep track of the visual novels I have read.

So I put my visual novels in the "About me" page.

However, the text in the about me treats line breaks in the file as line breaks for the actual displayed site.

So as a workaround, I have written a very tiny script to get around those limitations.

I may add a few bonuses (as I already have by adding a date) as time goes on, but for now, this will work.
